# igoldToken
This repo contains Solidity smart contract code to issue simple, standards-compliant tokens on Ethereum. It can be used to create any form of asset, currency, coin, hours, usage tokens, vunk, etc.

The default is StandardToken.sol which ONLY implements the core ERC20 standard functionality #20.

We have used ERC standard #20 as our interface.

igoldToken.sol is an example of a token that has optional extras fit for your issuing your own tokens, to be mainly used by other humans. It includes:

Standards allows other contract developers to easily incorporate your token into their application (governance, exchanges, games, etc). It will be updated as often as possible.
